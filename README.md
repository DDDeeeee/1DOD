    abstract = "Dialogue text segmentation aims to partition dialogue content into consecutive paragraphs based on themes or logic, enhancing its comprehensibility and manageability. Current text segmentation models, when applied directly to STS (Streaming Text Segmentation), exhibit numerous limitations, such as imbalances in labels that affect the stability of model training, and discrepancies between the model{'}s training tasks (sentence classification) and the actual text segmentation that limit the model{'}s segmentation capabilities.To address these challenges, we first implement STS for the first time using a sliding window-based segmentation method. Secondly, we employ two different levels of sliding window-based balanced label strategies to stabilize the training process of the streaming segmentation model and enhance training convergence speed. Finally, by adding a one-dimensional bounding-box regression task for text sequences within the window, we restructure the training approach of STS tasks, shifting from sentence classification to sequence segmentation, thereby aligning the training objectives with the task objectives, which further enhanced the model{'}s performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method is robust, controllable, and achieves state-of-the-art performance."
